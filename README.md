# IPC144-C-Programming-Assignments
## 📌 Course Description
**IPC144** is the introductory course to programming in the **C language**.  
It focuses on building a strong foundation in structured programming, problem-solving, and computational thinking.  
This repository contains my **workshops** and **milestones** completed during the course at **Seneca College**.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, I developed the ability to:
- Understand C syntax and program structure
- Use variables, operators, and control structures effectively
- Work with arrays, strings, and pointers
- Implement modular and reusable code using functions
- Perform file input/output operations
- Apply debugging and testing methodologies

## ⚙️ Setup & Compilation
To compile any `.c` file:
```bash
gcc filename.c -o program -Wall -std=c99
./program
````

For multiple files:

```bash
gcc file1.c file2.c -o program -Wall -std=c99
./program
```

## 🧪 Testing

* Each milestone includes **sample input/output** test cases.
* Outputs should match the **expected results provided by the instructor**.
* Debugging was performed using `gdb` and memory checks with `valgrind`.

---

## 📖 Key Topics Covered

* Variables & Operators
* Control Structures (`if`, `switch`)
* Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)
* Arrays & Strings
* Functions & Modular Programming
* Pointers & Dynamic Memory
* File Input/Output
